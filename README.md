# Note of Help with Source Code
I received help with source code from my Coding tutor Rene Trevino on writing the 
Javascript functions for past, present, future and local storage. Received help 
from the class TA Eric O. on Pseudocoding and adding the current date via day.js. 
Received help from classmate Ryan Kang on writing the function for the Event
Listener for the save buttons.

## Description

Challenge 5.  I was given code to refracter and add to. Added html div blocks for each hour of the work day.  Added Javascript code to make an event listener for the save button, save the values to local storage, and pull the value from local storage back to blocks, added the current date at the top of page, and wrote a function with a if statement to add classes to each hour that are either past, present or future. 

 Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

## User Story


AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
